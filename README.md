- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

I'm a working mum of a 1YO so I don't have as much time as I wish to dedicate on learning programing, however I love it so far and really want to continue in the long run.
